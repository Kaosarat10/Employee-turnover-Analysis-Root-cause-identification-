# Root Cause Analysis on High Employee Turnover  
*Using the 5 Why Technique*

The organization had been experiencing a rising rate of employee turnover, especially among mid-level professionals. Exit interviews often mentioned feeling "overworked," but no deeper analysis had been done to uncover the actual cause.  

There was a need for a structured investigation to uncover the root of the problem and suggest strategic actions to reduce the turnover rate.

##  Methodology – 5 Why Analysis  

A systematic approach to identify the root cause by continuously asking “Why?” until the foundational issue is discovered.

### Flow of Analysis:

1. **Why are employees leaving?**  
   → Because they feel overworked.

2. **Why do they feel overworked?**  
   → Because their workload is too high.

3. **Why is their workload too high?**  
   → Because there aren’t enough employees to share the workload.

4. **Why aren’t there enough staff members?**  
   → Because the company is not hiring enough people.

5. **Why is the company not hiring enough people?**  
   → Because the company prioritizes cost-cutting over workforce expansion.

##  Key Findings  

The main cause of employee turnover was traced to a cost-cutting strategy that limited hiring. This led to excessive workload on existing staff, causing burnout and eventual resignation.

---

##  Recommendations  

- **Review Workforce Plans**: Ensure staffing aligns with workload expectations.  
- **Flexible Hiring Models**: Use contractors or temporary hires when needed.  
- **Monitor Workload**: Set internal workload KPIs to prevent burnout.  
- **Employee Support**: Launch wellness programs and better engagement practices.
