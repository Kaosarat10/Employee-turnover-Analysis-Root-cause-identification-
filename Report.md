A systematic approach to identify the root cause by continuously asking ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù until the foundational issue is discovered.

   ‚Üí Because they feel overworked.

2. **Why do they feel overworked?**  
   ‚Üí Because their workload is too high.

3. **Why is their workload too high?**  
   ‚Üí Because there aren‚Äôt enough employees to share the workload.

4. **Why aren‚Äôt there enough staff members?**

- **Flexible Hiring Models**: Use contractors or temporary hires when needed.  
- **Monitor Workload**: Set internal workload KPIs to prevent burnout.
